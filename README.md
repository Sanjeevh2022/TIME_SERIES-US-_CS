Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI), an economic indicator used to predict changes in the outlook of a nation’s
economy is based on consumer interests and how likely they are to spend money, often in the succeeding
12 months. The most popular U.S. CSI, based on the University of Michigan’s ‘Surveys of Consumers’, has
been conducted since 1946. The type of questions that may be asked by surveyors in these indices range
from the likelihood of customers spending money in near future to addressing their fears of getting laid off
from work.In this report, we have tried to assess how consumer expectations match the actual events
through the method of Cross-Correlation. Cross-Correlation measures the degree of resemblance between a
time series and a lagged version of another time series to find out whether one-time series is a leading signal
for another.
